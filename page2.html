        <h2> Do What Assignment </h2>

        
            <p>-For our first assignment, we had to create a list
                of instructions and bring in 3 examples. </p>
            <p>-We then had to give the instructions to a classmate
                and observe their finished work. </p>
            <p>-These are the instructions: </p>
            
        <div class="indent">
            <p> 1. Grab a pen and a piece of paper</p>
            <p> 2. Draw 3 small to medium V's in a line, touching at the tops.</p>
            <p> 3. Now draw a zig-zag line about a quarter away from 
                    the bottom of each V- within the boundaries of each V.</p> 
            <p> 4. About a half an inch below one of your V's, draw a circle that 
                    is smaller than your V's. </p> 
            <p> 5. Fill in the circle.</p> 
            <p> 6. Flip page over. </p>  
            <p> -Here is a collage of my three examples doing this experiment 
            and one (in blue) that my classmate did. </p>
